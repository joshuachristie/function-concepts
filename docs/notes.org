* Three-dimensions of function text-mining project

** First stage (pilot study)
Zach has compiled the list of journals that we will search in (hopefully via Crossref) to get our corpus.
I have sent the list of publishers and journals off to the university library, and they will get back to me about licensing agreements, etc.
Zach has extracted the "function" phrases from a couple of papers.
(The original plan was to go through 45 different papers from the nine different categories (one from each of the top five journals in a category), but we'll have to see how we go for time.)
Eventually, I will fully automate the processing of full texts (extraction of function sentences, context, and other metadata), but for now I just want to quickly partially automate it, to save Zach the time of having to manually process papers. For starters, I will use grobid with xml.etree.ElementTree.
