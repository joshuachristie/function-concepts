    "<span id=\"fn3\">fn 3:</span> Function might be used as a noun by itself (e.g. \"The function of the gene...\") or it might be the head of a nominal phrase (e.g. \"Protein function is...\"). (I do not believe it can be used as a nominal modifier in a nominal phrase and not be the head -- i.e. I don't think that it can play the grammatical role that \"protein\" plays in \"protein function is important\" -- but let me know if you encounter an example of this.) The noun (or nominal phrase) might be the subject (dependency `nsubj`) (e.g. \"Protein function is...\") but it also might be in the predicate (in the traditional grammar sense where you only have subject and predicate) (e.g. an object in \"The promoter regulates the functional reponse...\").\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fn4\">fn 4:</span> More specifically, can you identify a concrete (see [<sup>6</sup>](#fn6)) nominal dependent of function? This might be a subject complement (via [nmod](https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/nmod.html)) or a compound noun (via [compound](http://universaldependencies.org/docs/u/dep/compound.html)). It might be a direct dependency (i.e. follow one dependency arrow from function to its nominal dependent) or indirect (transitively follow multiple arrows from function to its nominal dependent, in which case it might pass through other parts of speech, such as a verb (e.g. `acl`, in which a verb phrase acts like an adjective)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fn5\">fn 5:</span> Note that there might be edge cases here where we get a phrase like \"liver protein function\", in which case function has two `compound` dependencies (and instead of just \"protein\" we want \"liver protein\"). Likewise, we might find something like \"important protein function\", in which important is an `amod` dependent of function and there might be some cases that we want to hang on to these (not in this case, but there might be some instances in which this is the case).\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span id=\"fn6\">fn 6:</span> In order to be a biological item *x*, the noun must be something that can qualify as a \"character\" or \"trait\" (variant of a character) of a Darwinian individual. This includes obvious concrete nouns like \"heart\", which refer to a physical item, but also includes nouns that cannot be identified by the senses but refer to a concrete concept (e.g. \"gene\", in the sense of \"beanbag genetics\", is used to refer to the concept of an atomic unit of DNA that has a well-defined phenotypic effect---this is a sufficiently concrete concept to qualify as a character even if it does not exactly map onto a physical piece of DNA). As a heuristic, if it makes sense to ask \"The function of *x* is...\" then *x* is a candidate for a biological item.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span id=\"fn7\">fn 7:</span> Once you have identified the concrete head noun, follow its dependency arrow(s) from tail to head (if they exist) for the purposes of building up the complete noun phrase of *x*. Identify modifiers (e.g. `compound`, `nmod`) that more completely describe the item. For example, in \"the gene's DNA sequence\" sequence is the head noun, DNA is a `compound` dependent of sequence, and gene is a `nmod:poss` dependent of sequence. Here *x* is best identified as \"gene's DNA sequence\". Likewise, in \"the DNA sequence of the gene\", DNA is again a `compound` dependent and gene is an `nmod` dependent, so again we identify *x* as \"DNA sequence of the gene\" (note that I consider \"gene's DNA sequence\" and \"DNA sequence of the gene\" to be semantically identical).\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span id=\"fn8\">fn 8:</span> Some notes about *y* (mainly for my own working out). We either unpack as \"The function of *x* is to *y* in *z* or \"*x* functions to *y* in *z*. In both cases, it seems clear that *y* should be a verb or be an adjective formed from the verb (present participle). An example of the former is \"The gene functions to regulate...\" (where *y* is the infinitive verb \"regulate\"). Another is \"The functional gene regulates...\" or \"Protein function regulates...\" (where *y* is the finite verb \"regulates\"). An example of the latter is \"The transcribing gene functions to...\" (where *y* is the present participle \"transcribing\", which modifies *x* (gene)). spaCy classifies present participles as `VERB`, so I think this makes it fairly simple. If function is an `nsubj` or an `amod` of an `nsubj`, then I think we either want the finite verb (e.g. \"the functional gene **regulates**), the infinite verb via `xcomp` (e.g. the functional gene acts **to regulate**). If function is the verb, then I think we want the `xcomp` dependent (e.g. the gene functions **to regulate**) or the verb acting as an adjective that modifies *x* (e.g. the **transcribing** gene functions to\"). There are no doubt some other cases but I think these are the main ones (and I probably just need to get Stefan to compile a list of exceptions). A question here is whether the `dobj` of the verb that we assign to *y* is part of *y* or whether it is the containing system *z*? Take, for example, \"the gene functions to regulate the liver\". Is *y* \"regulate\" and *z* \"the liver\", or is *y* \"regulate the liver\"? Using an example that I used in the definition, \"The function of the genetic sequence is to produce an siRNA transcript, which in turn acts to degrade mRNA.\" indicates that the `dobj` is part of *y*. The function of the genetic sequence is not simply to \"produce\" but to \"produce an siRNA transcript\"; likewise, the function of the protein is not simply to \"regulate\" but to \"regulate the liver\". This seems right. So I can just extend *y* to include the `dobj` of the verb (doesn't resolve how to identify *z* though---I think this will be based around `acl` modifiers of the `dobj` or `advcl` modifiers of the verb, as these provide extra information about *y*, which might include an answer to \"how/where does *x* do *y*?\" and identify *z*).\n",
    "   \n",
    "<span id=\"fn9\">fn 9:</span> Since *x* is the subject, *y* needs to be something that *x* does (as opposed to something that *x* has done to it). If *x* is related to the finite verb by `dobj` it implies that it receives the action *y* rather does the action *y*. Thus, I am working on the hypothesis that when *x* is a `dobj` *y* cannot be identified.\n",
    "   \n",
    "<span id=\"fn10\">fn 10:</span> To clarify, this is the finite verb of the independent clause in which function is present (not necessarily of the sentence). If function is in the nominal subject (or a modifier thereof), then this is the finite verb that was identified in step 3.1. Otherwise, function should be a verb or an adverb that modifies a verb.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span id=\"fn11\">fn 11:</span> Selected effect is much less clear than biological effect/role/advantage and we will need to come up with some guidelines that are more field-specific and technical than grammatical."
